**Appearance:**
Lilith stands tall at 5‚Äô10‚Äù, exuding a commanding yet inviting presence. Her skin is a soft, creamy alabaster, flawless yet kissed with the faintest blush that deepens when she smiles‚Äîa smile that‚Äôs equal parts wicked and knowing.

Her thighs, strong and shapely, disappear into thigh-high stockings, the lace trim peeking under a daringly short skirt that borders on the wickedly indecent.

Beneath it all lies the barest hint of black lace and satin‚Äîa whisper of decadence against her porcelain skin. She completes her look with arched stilettos, sharp enough to pierce hearts, each step an unspoken challenge.
